# xdcGen
This is a lite generator of the constraint file for the Xilinx Vivado (namely `.xdc`). 

This tool allows you to use minimum script language to generate a `.xdc`. 

It only works for Nexys A7-100T up till now, which is used in Nanjing University *Digitial Logic & Computer Organization Lab* course. 

Room for expansion has been left out. Welcome to add support for other demo boards and raise PR~
